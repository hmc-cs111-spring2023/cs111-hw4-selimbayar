# Initial thoughts about Scala

My initial thoughts on Scala are much better than I expected. Learning a new language is always hard, but I feel like I got the hang of it quite well. The language is simple, and the syntax is a little bit different from what I am used to, but not hard to adapt.

I feel like creating functions are easy on Scala, as we do not even have to put 'return' in the end. However, initializing them with the types were harder to adapt. I am used Python and Java where I do not need to specify the input and output types while defining, but in Scala we have to. Also getting used to the 'val' and the 'var' was a bit difficult, as I always keep on forgetting to put them when declaring a variable. Other than that, it did not feel too hard getting used to.

My favorite language design choices of Scala is not having to put a ';' at the end of every statement, and the fact that we are able to return whatever we want without even using the return function, which I think is cool. I like these choices because I feel like it makes the code look better and simpler, which makes it more interesting and likeable for new users like me.

My least favorite language design choice of Scala is to have to use 'val' and 'var' before declaring a variable. I don't like this because I feel better just writing something like 'x = 0' and not worrying later if I can change it or not. I think the designers might have done this to clearly separate which variables can be changed and which can not, but I feel like that is a bit unnecessary, and that can be done with something like the constant variables in Java, if needed. I also don't like theb 'readline()' function to get input from the user, as I felt like it was a bit confusing. The 'input()' from Python makes it so much easier in my opinion.

I got a good sense of recursions and defining functions and variables, but I haven't really got into for loops at all, so I would like to see more on that, and how to properly use nested loops. I also would like to learn more about inputs to become more confident on them, as I still feel a bit confused when getting inputs from the user.

Overall, I liked Scala as a language, much more than I expected, and would definitely want to become someone who can easily and confidently write code on Scala.
